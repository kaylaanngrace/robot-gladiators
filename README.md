## DESCRIPTION:
My motive for this project is to become more efficent in web development/coding. Also to become proficent in understanding and using JavaScript.

## LEARNED/LEARNING:
In this module I learned that primitive data types establish how data is stored and manipulated. Function offer control over the applications actions which can help isolate potential bugs and data variables and they can be invoked when wanted. Objects give you the ability to store properties and methods. Control flow statements, such as conditional statements and for and while loops, can be used to direct the order of operations and behavior of the application. I learned to utilize console.log and Chrome Dev tools debugger to find issues and run my code. 

## PROCCESS/INSTALLTION:
First I set up the MVP of the game. Secondly, I created GitHub issues to track and manage bugs and features. Then I validated player input before to working on the rest. Then I refactored the code to be more organized and simple. Finally I fixed bugs and added a few enhancements, using localStorage to store player's highscore.

## USAGE: 
To play the game open Chrome Dev tools, console. You can do this by holding 'Command/CTRL + Option + J' . Then you can proceed through the game following the prompts. You can view your highscore in the application area to the right of console under local storage. 
## CREDITS:

This game was built with the guidance of the UofMn Coding BootCamp.
